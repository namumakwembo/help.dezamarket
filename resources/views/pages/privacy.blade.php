Welcome to Dezamarket! Please take a moment to review our Privacy Policy carefully. Your engagement with the Dezamarket website and platform implies your consent to abide by this Privacy Policy.


## 1. Information Provided Through the Service:
Any information you furnish through Dezamarket, whether it's product listings or other submissions, falls under the purview of our Privacy Policy. You affirm and assure that all information you provide is both accurate and comprehensive, and you commit to maintaining and updating it as necessary.


## 2. Platform Policies:
When using Dezamarket, you are bound by our platform policies, which encompass directives regarding prohibited items, services, and our code of conduct. You can find these policies on our website.

## 3. Registration; Usernames and Passwords:
To fully utilize Dezamarket, you may find it necessary to complete a registration process. We retain the right to reject or request alterations to your registration details. For your account's security, please safeguard your username and password, as you are accountable for all activities linked to your account. If you suspect any compromise of your account information, it is imperative that you promptly notify us. Should you choose to register using social media credentials, you grant us permission to access, employ, and store your social media information, consistent with the terms delineated in our Privacy Policy.

## 4. Product Listings:
Dezamarket serves as a platform enabling users to create and browse product listings. It is important to note that these listings are the creations of users, not Dezamarket. We do not partake in the sale, rental, or provision of any products. Except as expressly outlined in this Privacy Policy, we bear no responsibility for these product listings. It is strongly advised to exercise prudence and employ common sense when engaging in transactions related to product listings.

The presence or promotion of any product listing on Dezamarket should not be construed as an endorsement on our part. Information associated with listings is subject to change without prior notice, and we retain the authority to remove listings for any reason.

By publishing a product listing, you affirm that you possess the requisite authority and permissions to do so.

## 5. Submissions:
You have the option to submit information that personally identifies you through product listings and various interactive channels on Dezamarket. You are fully responsible for your submissions. We do not exert control over how third parties may employ or misuse your submissions.

## 6. License:
While you maintain ownership of your submissions, you grant us an international, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, irrevocable, transferable, and sublicensable license to utilize your submissions for a variety of purposes, including promotional activities. Should you furnish us with feedback, it will be categorized as a submission, and you bestow similar rights upon us.

By making these grants, you affirm that you hold the requisite rights to confer these licenses and that your submissions are comprehensive, accurate, and in compliance with applicable laws.

## 7. Oversight:
We retain the prerogative to monitor, assess, amend, or delete your postings on Dezamarket and to evaluate your usage of the platform. We may disclose information pertaining to your Dezamarket usage to any party for any reason or purpose, all in accordance with our Disclosure Statement.

## 8. Your Limited Rights:
Dezamarket is a service designed exclusively for end users, and it does not entail the transfer of any rights. We hereby grant you permission to install and use the Dezamarket Application on a mobile device that you own or control, strictly for your personal use and in compliance with this Agreement.

- Cease all use of the Application immediately.
- Uninstall the Application from your mobile device, including its complete removal.
- Refrain from using the Application on any mobile device until express permission to do so is granted, which may occur at a later time.

You are also responsible for acquiring, maintaining, and covering the costs of any hardware, telecommunications, or other services required to utilize the Dezamarket Service.

Furthermore, provided you adhere to this Agreement and for as long as Dezamarket grants you access to the Site, you are authorized to view one (1) copy of any part of the Site accessible to you under this Agreement. This authorization is for your personal, non-commercial use on any device.
